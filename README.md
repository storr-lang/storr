# Storr

The Storr programming language

Named after Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr; a German physician, chemist, and
naturalist.
Storr is a taxonomic authority of 6 genera: Mellivora, Nasua, Phalanger,
Procavia, Procyon, and Tarsius.
The logo is a tree of the taxonomic ranks of these taxa.

Storr is a statically-typed, functional, general purpose programming language.
Typing is inferred and the language is designed to be simple and expressive.
The syntax is inspired by Python, Haskell, and Rust.
